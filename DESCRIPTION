Description: Given a sample with additive measurement error, the package estimates the deconvolution density - that is, the density of the underlying distribution of the sample without measurement error. The method maximises the log-likelihood of the estimated density, plus a quadratic smoothness penalty. The distribution of the measurement error can be either a known family, or can be estimated from a "pure error" sample. For known error distributions, the package supports Normal, Laplace or Beta distributed error. For unknown error distribution, a pure error sample independent from the data is used.
